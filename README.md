# On This Day

## Description
Insert events that happened on this day in history.

## Usage
Open the command palette and run the `On This Day: Insert` command.

## Network requests and the event source
This plugin makes a request to my own API project to get the events, located at https://onthisday.zwart-hart.nl/api/v1/events/that-happend-on/{month}/{day}.
The API is open source and can be found at https://github.com/Milanzor/on-this-day-api/
